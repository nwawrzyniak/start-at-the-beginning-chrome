# start-at-the-beginning-chrome
This is the official repository for "Start at the beginning" – a Google Chrome extension that lets you start YouTube videos at the beginning, ignoring the watch progress which YouTube tracks.

This is especially useful for playlists with a lot of videos with different watch progresses, videos that were closed shortly before the endcard and music videos that were started and unfinished.

The plugin can be easily activated and deactivated from the navigation bar – no need to go into the Google Chrome extension settings every time.
